# Jungo DAO

Jungo DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that brings together 
experts in science and technology to govern and shape the JungoAI Network. 

Through Jungo DAO, members gain voting power and influence key decisions that 
drive the development of JungoAI Network. Governance remains community-led, 
ensuring innovation is guided by expertise rather than corporate interests. 
It follows a proof-of-expertise model, where voting power is based on knowledge and 
contributions rather than just token holdings.
Contributors are also rewarded with `JUNGO` tokens for their participation.

DAO members approve projects, set policies, and guide network growth, while 
earning `JUNGO` tokens as incentives. This approach ensures that the network evolves 
based on expert knowledge, benefiting both contributors and the broader decentralized community.
