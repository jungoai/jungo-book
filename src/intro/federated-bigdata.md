# Federated Big Data

Federated Big Data is an innovative approach to managing and analyzing large datasets across
multiple decentralized locations. Unlike traditional centralized systems, where data is collected and
processed in a single location, federated big data leverages the power of distributed networks to
enhance privacy, scalability, and collaboration.

JungoAIâ€™s goal is to provide a protocol that enables public nodes to participate in delivering
big data solutions for various real-world applications, including indexing and analyzing blockchains,
collecting and analyzing web data, and more.
