# What is JungoAI

JungoAI is a public, decentralized platform designed to enable 
the development of **Federated AI**, **Big Data**, and DeSci solutions. 
It allows researchers, developers, and innovators to collaborate on 
AI models and data-driven projects without relying on centralized companies.

By leveraging blockchain and decentralized governance, JungoAI ensures 
data security, privacy, and open access for the global community. 
Experts can contribute their knowledge, computation power, or research data, 
earning `JUNGO` tokens as rewards. Governed by **Jungo DAO**, the network maintains a 
transparent and expert-led ecosystem that fosters collaboration and innovation.
