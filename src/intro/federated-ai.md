# Federated AI

Most AI algorithms are designed to be centralized. Data and computation need to be in a centralized
location, which means only large organizations with the resources to collect vast amounts of data
and sufficient computational power can develop these solutions.

The major drawback of centralized AIs is the presence of a single authority, which can lead to
models trained on biased data, resulting in biased outcomes. Additionally, similar to the dominance
of search engines over the past decades, only a few entities can possess the technology and reap
the benefits. Platforms like [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com) attempt to leverage blockchain technology to incentivize
experts, entities, and node operators to participate in developing AI solutions. However, these
platforms function more like marketplaces and competitive AI solutions. At JungoAI, our goal is to
build a Federated AI solution where network nodes collaborate to provide data and computation.
