# Big Data Layer for Blockchains

## Introduction

Jungo Data3 is a public big data layer that makes blockchain and Web3 data accessible, 
searchable, and decentralized. By leveraging a network of distributed nodes, 
it indexes and analyzes blockchain data, providing a scalable and open resource for 
DApps and blockchain clients. This enables developers and users to efficiently query, retrieve
and analyze blockchain data, driving Web3 growth.

## Challenges in Blockchain Data Accessibility

Blockchains are excellent for building secure and immutable transactional databases and 
DApps but face big data accessibility issues:

- **Centralized RPCs** – Blockchain gateways lack decentralization, affecting reliability and 
  accessibility.
- **Lack of Searchability** – Blockchain data isn’t inherently searchable, making DApps rely on 
  costly custom indexing solutions.
- **Trustless Data Retrieval** – Fetching specific data from blockchains for DApps and 
  mini clients is not trustless.
- **Limited Indexing Protocols** – Existing solutions are single-chain, lack real-world 
  data integration, and require significant development effort.

Ethereum and blockchains were envisioned as decentralized computers, but currently, 
they function more as decentralized storage. A big data layer that makes 
blockchain data searchable and easily accessible is still missing in Web3.

## Jungo Data3: The Solution

Jungo Data3 provides a public and decentralized solution by operating as a subnet of 
Jungo Network, where nodes collaborate to deliver big data services for blockchains. 
This includes:

- P2P & Decentralized RPCs
- General Indexing Protocols
- Data Pipelines & Web3 Lambda Services

Jungo Data3 eliminates the need for DApps to build expensive data infrastructure, 
offering a cost-effective, scalable, and decentralized big data layer.


## Jungo Data3 Architecture & Services

Jungo Network’s base layer provides essential infrastructure, including distributed 
databases, communication channels, job queues, and federated big data capabilities. 
Jungo Data3 runs different types of nodes that collaborate to provide a robust 
blockchain big data layer:

- RPC Nodes – Provide P2P and decentralized RPC services, eliminating 
  single points of failure in blockchain RPCs.
- Blockchain Indexer Nodes – Extract data from RPC nodes and index blockchain transactions, 
  smart contract events, and more, making them searchable.
- DApp Indexer Nodes – Allow projects to build and query custom databases tailored to 
  their DApp and protocol needs.
- Multichain Indexer Nodes – Enable multichain DApps to aggregate and analyze data from 
  multiple blockchains.
- Web3 Lambda Services & Pipelines – Combine on-chain and real-world data, allowing DApps to 
  build custom databases and microservices without needing separate infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The Web3 ecosystem and every blockchain deserve to have a general, reliable big data layer to 
improve blockchain data accessibility. Jungo Data3 aims to simplify DApp development, 
reduce infrastructure costs, and bring Web3-based solutions to replace 
traditional Web2 big data markets. By decentralizing big data services, Jungo Data3 makes 
blockchain data truly open, accessible, and scalable for everyone.
